Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream, becoming an enduring pop culture icon and conquering the world in the process. Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin, revealing that she was perhaps the savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse.

These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute "Tim Mcgraw," but her second album, 2008's Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and in the processm finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up haing considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked uo six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits "Love Story" and "You Belong With Me," but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia.
