#Questions:
#1: What is the most danceable song?
#2: What is the most danceable album on average?
#3: What is the most energetic song?
#4: What is the most energetic album on average?
#5: How does energy correlate to danceability?
#6: What is the most acoustic song?
#7: What is sthe most acoustic album?
#8: What is the trend in acousticness over time?

#Question 1: What is the most danceable song?
dancing = taylor_data[['track_name', 'danceability']].sort_values('danceability', ascending=False)
dancing_max = dancing.head(1)
print(dancing_max)
#Observe that the track 'I Think He Knows' is the most danceable with a danceability of 0.897

#Question 2: What is the most danceable album on average?
dancing_albums = taylor_data[['album_name', 'danceability']].groupby(['album_name'])
dancing_albums_sorted = dancing_albums.first().sort_values('danceability', ascending=False)
dancing_albums_max = dancing_albums_sorted.head(1)
print(dancing_albums_max)
#Observe that the album '1989' is the most danceable with an average danceability of 0.789

#Question 3:  What is the most energetic song?
energy = taylor_data[['track_name', 'energy']].sort_values('energy', ascending=False)
energy_max = energy.head(1)
print(energy_max)
#Observe that the track 'Haunted' is the most energetic with a energy level of 0.95

#Question 4: What is the most energetic album on average?
energy_albums = taylor_data[['album_name', 'energy']].groupby(['album_name'])
energy_albums_sorted = energy_albums.first().sort_values('energy', ascending=False)
energy_albums_max = energy_albums_sorted.head(1)
print(energy_albums_max)
#Observe that the album 'Red' is the most energetic with an average energy level of 0.825

#Question 5: How does energy correlate to danceability?
energy_lst = pd.DataFrame(energy)['energy'].tolist()

plt.scatter(energy_lst, dancing_lst)
plt.title("Energy vs. Danceability")
plt.xlabel("Energy")
plt.ylabel("Danceability")
plt.show()
#Observe that the energy and danceability are almost linearly related. As energy of the song increases, so the the danceability.

#Question 6: What is the most acoustic song?
acoustic = taylor_data[['track_name', 'acousticness']].sort_values('acousticness', ascending=False)
acoustic_max = acoustic.head(1)
print(acoustic_max)
#Observe that the track 'It's Nice To Have A Friend' is the most acoustic with an acousticness of 0.971

#Question 7: What is the most acoustic album?
acoustic_albums = taylor_data[['album_name', 'acousticness']].groupby(['album_name'])
acoustic_albums_sorted = acoustic_albums.first().sort_values('acousticness', ascending=False)
acoustic_albums_max = acoustic_albums_sorted.head(1)
print(acoustic_albums_max)
#Observe that the album 'evermore' is the most acoustic with an average acousticness of 0.833

#Question 8: What is the trend in acousticness over time?
